    <h3>Desctiption:</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a hearty, layered pasta dish that's both comforting and satisfying. To begin, prepare your meat sauce by sautéing chopped onions and garlic in olive oil, then browning ground beef or Italian sausage. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of Italian herbs like basil and oregano. Let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes to develop deep flavor. Meanwhile, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions, or use no-boil noodles for convenience. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an egg, salt, pepper, and a bit of Parmesan for a creamy filling.</p>
    <p>Once all components are ready, assemble the lasagna in a baking dish. Start with a thin layer of sauce at the bottom, followed by noodles, then a layer of ricotta mixture, more sauce, and shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layers, finishing with a generous amount of sauce and mozzarella on top. Cover the dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden. Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
